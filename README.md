# Q-Learning-Algorithm

A Matlab implementation of the Q-Learning Algorithm with known number of states. The problem chosen to solve was the apartment problem where the states are given according to the following graph.

The agent is allowed to visit the states according to the available transitions in the graph. Any transition that is not available is given as a 0 in the action and -1 in the initial R matrix.
